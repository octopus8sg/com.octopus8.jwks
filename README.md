1. Run **npm install** to download packages.
2. Run **node generator** to generate a pair of public and private JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) which will be created in individual JSON files: *private-jwks.json* & *public-jwks.json*.
3. You will then be able to use the JWKS for encrypting, decrypting, signing, and verifying JWTs (JSON Web Tokens).
